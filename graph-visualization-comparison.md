## Performance Benchmarks

### Dataset Size Recommendations

| **Dataset Size** | **Best Choice** | **Reasoning** |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| < 1K nodes | Either works well | Choose based on 2D vs 3D preference |
| 1K - 5K nodes | **Three.js** if 3D needed | Good performance, visual impact |
| 5K - 10K nodes | **Sigma.js preferred** | Better performance, more reliable |
| 10K+ nodes | **Sigma.js only** | Three.js hits memory limits |
| 100K+ nodes | **Sigma.js optimized** | Requires careful optimization |

### Rendering Performance (2015 MacBook baseline)

| **Technology** | **Node Limit** | **Edge Limit** | **Performance** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| SVG | 2K nodes | 2K edges | Workable |
| Canvas | 5K nodes | 5K edges | Good |
| Sigma.js WebGL | 10K+ nodes | 11K+ edges | Excellent |
| 3d-force-graph | ~10K nodes | Limited by memory | Variable |

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose **Sigma.js** when:
- 📊 **Large datasets** (10K+ nodes) are primary requirement
- ⚡ **Performance** is critical
- 📱 **Browser compatibility** (older devices) is important
- 💼 **Production applications** requiring stability
- 📈 **Network analysis** and traditional graph layouts
- 🎯 **Supply chain visualization** with many connections

### Choose **Three.js + 3d-force-graph** when:
- 🎨 **Visual presentation** and impact are priorities
- 🔍 **Spatial relationships** benefit from 3D representation
- 📊 **Smaller datasets** (< 10K nodes)
- 🎯 **Interactive demonstrations** or showcases
- 🔬 **Scientific visualization** requiring depth perception
- 💡 **Innovation projects** where 3D adds clear value

## Integration Considerations

### Current Project Context
Your supply chain visualization project features:
- **2M - 4M nodes** with equal edge counts
- **Complex multi-tier relationships** (6 supply chain levels)
- **Performance requirements** for large-scale data
- **Filter and interaction** capabilities needed

**Recommendation**: **Sigma.js is the clear choice** for your project due to:
1. Proven ability to handle millions of nodes
2. Better performance with your large datasets
3. More suitable for network/supply chain visualization
4. Already implemented and working well in your current setup

### Migration Path
If you want to experiment with Three.js later:
1. Keep Sigma.js for production large-scale views
2. Add Three.js for smaller subset visualizations
3. Use Three.js for 3D "detail views" of graph clusters
4. Implement as complementary visualization modes

## Conclusion

For **large-scale graph visualization** (10K+ nodes), **Sigma.js** is the superior choice due to its:
- Optimized 2D WebGL rendering
- Proven performance with large datasets  
- Lower resource requirements
- Production stability

For **smaller graphs** where **3D visualization adds significant value**, **Three.js + 3d-force-graph** provides:
- Enhanced spatial representation
- Superior visual impact
- Advanced customization options

Your current **2M-4M node supply chain project** is perfectly suited for **Sigma.js** and would likely face severe performance issues with Three.js-based solutions.
